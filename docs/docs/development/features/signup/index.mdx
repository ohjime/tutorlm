# Signup Overview

The signup feature guides new users through a dynamic onboarding flow that adapts to their chosen profile and collects all necessary information in a single process. Users can upload files, set their availability, and configure their preferences without downloading multiple apps or hunting for additional settings. This streamlined experience reduces confusion and simplifies account setup.

## Dependencies

The core signup logic is managed by its state machine, which has one direct external dependency:

- [`flutter_bloc`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc): Provides the BLoC pattern for state management, decoupling business logic from UI and facilitating testing.

The signup UI is built in Flutter and relies on the following packages:

- [`flutter_form_builder`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_form_builder): Comprehensive form widgets and utilities.
- [`form_builder_validators`](https://pub.dev/packages/form_builder_validators): Validation functions for form inputs.
- [`image_picker`](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker): Enables file and image uploads during onboarding.
- [`awesome_dialog`](https://pub.dev/packages/awesome_dialog): Displays modal dialogs for file upload feedback and error handling.

Further details on the Signup State Machine and its Views are available in the sub-sections below:
