# Testing

## Overview

The testing strategy for this project primarily revolves around unit tests, meticulously organized within the `test/core` directory. This directory is further subdivided into `models` and `repositories`, reflecting a clear separation of concerns in the testing approach.

### Types of Tests and Their Scope

1.  **Model Tests (`test/core/models/`)**: These are pure unit tests focused on validating the correctness of the core data structures (models) of the application. They ensure that:
    *   Object instantiation and construction (including edge cases and validation) behave as expected.
    *   Methods and logic within the models (e.g., `copyWith`, `toJson`, `fromJson`, custom getters, equality checks, `toString` representations) function correctly.
    *   Serialization and deserialization processes are robust and maintain data integrity.
    *   Enum definitions and their associated properties are accurate.

2.  **Repository Tests (`test/core/repositories/`)**: These tests verify the data access layer. While they are unit tests in the sense that they test individual repository classes, they also serve as a form of integration testing for the domain models with the data persistence layer (Firestore) and authentication services. This is achieved through:
    *   **Dependency Injection**: Repositories are designed to accept instances of their dependencies (e.g., `FirebaseAuth`, `FirebaseFirestore`, `FirebaseStorage`) via their constructors. During testing, mock or fake implementations (e.g., `MockFirebaseAuth`, `FakeFirebaseFirestore`, `MockFirebaseStorage`) are injected. This allows for the isolation of the repository logic from live external services, leading to predictable, fast, and reliable tests. The primary purpose of dependency injection here is to enable testability by decoupling components and allowing for controlled test environments.
    *   **CRUD Operations**: Tests cover the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for each repository, ensuring that data is correctly transformed and persisted to/retrieved from the (mocked) database.
    *   **Stream Handling**: For repositories that expose data streams (e.g., `AuthenticationRepository`, `SessionRepository`), tests verify that these streams emit the correct data in response to changes in the underlying (mocked) data source.
    *   **Authentication Flows**: The `AuthenticationRepository` tests cover various authentication scenarios like sign-up, login (email/password and Google), and logout.
    *   **File Storage**: The `StorageRepository` tests ensure that file upload logic, including path and filename manipulation, functions as intended using a mock storage solution.

### Current Testing Landscape and Future Considerations

The current suite of tests provides a solid foundation by ensuring the reliability of the core business logic and data handling mechanisms.

*   **Integration of Domain Models with Firestore**: The repository tests, by interacting with `FakeFirebaseFirestore`, effectively act as integration tests between the application's domain models and the Firestore database structure and rules (as simulated by the fake implementation). They validate that the models can be correctly serialized to and deserialized from the expected Firestore document format.

*   **Areas for Expansion**:
    *   **BLoC Tests**: A notable omission is the testing of BLoC (Business Logic Component) classes. BLoCs are crucial as they integrate repositories with the UI layer, managing state and handling user interactions. Future work should include comprehensive BLoC tests to ensure that UI events trigger the correct business logic and that state changes are emitted as expected.
    *   **Widget Tests**: Flutter's widget tests allow for testing UI components in isolation. While acknowledged as potentially "unwieldy," incorporating widget tests for critical UI components would enhance confidence in the UI's behavior and appearance.
    *   **Full Integration Tests**: True end-to-end integration tests, potentially running on a real device or emulator with live Firebase services (in a controlled test project), would provide the highest level of confidence but are typically more complex and slower to run.

### Code Coverage

Assessing the precise code coverage percentage requires dedicated tools and integration into the CI/CD pipeline. While the existing tests cover a significant portion of the model and repository logic, a formal code coverage analysis would identify any untested code paths and guide further test development. It is recommended to implement such analysis to ensure comprehensive test coverage across the application.
