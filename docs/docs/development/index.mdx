# Development Overview
This document details the software architecture strategy for TutorLM. Our approach is fundamentally geared towards creating a system that is modular, scalable, easily testable, and straightforward to maintain over time. To achieve these goals, we primarily employ a feature-first organizational structure, where the codebase is segmented by distinct application capabilities. This structure is further reinforced by principles inspired by Clean Architecture, which guide us in establishing a clear separation of concerns across different layers of the application.


The architecture is built upon several core tenets:

- **Modularity:** Features are developed as largely independent units.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between UI logic, core business rules, and data handling.
- **Dependency Rule:** Dependencies point inwardsâ€”from Presentation to Domain, with Data serving Domain.
- **Testability:** Each layer/component can be verified in isolation.
- **Scalability & Maintainability:** New features integrate with minimal disruption; codebase remains organized and adaptable.

---

### Architectural Layers and Code Structure

The application is conceptually divided into three primary layers:

1. **Presentation (Application) Layer**
2. **Domain Layer**
3. **Data Layer**

Physically, the codebase reflects this through feature-specific folders, a central `core` folder, and an `app` folder, each with a distinct role.

---

### Feature-Driven Development

The cornerstone of our organizational strategy is a **feature-based approach**. Each significant capability (e.g., Authentication, Session Management, Chat, User Profile) is encapsulated within its own folder (e.g., `lib/auth/`, `lib/session/`).

- **UI, state management, and feature logic are co-located.**
- **Feature modules are highly independent,** depending mainly on the `core` folder (for shared business logic, domain models, repository interfaces) and occasionally the `app` folder (for global configs, routing, shared state).
- **Direct dependencies between features are minimized,** promoting decoupling and isolation.

---

### The Presentation Layer

Responsible for everything the user sees and interacts with:

- **UI Components:** Widgets/Views in each feature folder (e.g., `lib/session/view/`, `lib/session/widgets/`).
- **State Management:** Predominantly uses the Bloc library. Each feature has its own Blocs or Cubits (e.g., `lib/session/bloc/`).
  - **Blocs:** For complex state with multiple events and transformations.
  - **Cubits:** For simpler, lightweight state management.
- **UI widgets listen to state changes** (using `BlocBuilder` or similar) and rebuild accordingly.
- **User actions** are dispatched as events to Blocs or as method calls to Cubits.
- **The `app` folder** (e.g., `lib/app/`):
  - Manages global state (e.g., authentication status, theme, localization) via a global `AppBloc`.
  - Handles root navigation setup and app lifecycle management.

**Interaction Flow:**
- UI reacts to Bloc/Cubit state changes.
- User interactions are channeled to state management components.
- Blocs/Cubits interact with repositories in the Domain Layer.

---

### The Domain Layer

Encapsulated primarily within the `core` folder. This is the application's business logic and core data structures.

- **Domain Models (Entities):** Plain Dart objects (e.g., `User`, `Session`, `Course` in `lib/core/models/`).
- **Repository Interfaces:** Abstract contracts (e.g., `AuthenticationRepository`, `SessionRepository` in `lib/core/repositories/`).
- **Use Cases:** (Optional) Encapsulate specific business logic/user stories.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **No Flutter-specific code.**
- **No widgets or Flutter dependencies.**
- **Platform-agnostic and highly testable.**

---

### The Data Layer

Responsible for data retrieval, storage, and communication with external/local sources. Provides concrete implementations for repository interfaces.

- **Repository Implementations:** In `lib/core/repositories/`, implement interfaces from the Domain Layer (e.g., `SessionRepositoryImpl`).
- **Data Sources:**
  - **External Services/SDKs:** Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM, Google Sign-In, etc.
  - **Local Data Sources:** (If needed) SQLite, shared preferences, etc.
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Used for mapping between external data and Domain Models.
- **Data Transformation:** Converts raw data (e.g., Firestore docs, JSON) to Domain Models and vice versa.

> **Note:** Even without a dedicated `data_sources` sub-folder, the Data Layer's responsibilities are fulfilled by repository implementations that interact with SDKs.

---

### Understanding Interaction and Data Flow

The architecture promotes a clear, unidirectional flow of data and dependencies:

1. **User Interaction** occurs in a UI widget.
2. **Event/Action** is dispatched to a Bloc/Cubit.
3. **Bloc/Cubit** communicates with a Repository Interface (Domain Layer).
4. **Repository Interface** is routed to its Concrete Implementation (Data Layer) via Dependency Injection.
5. **Repository Implementation** interacts with the Data Source (e.g., Firebase).
6. **Data is Retrieved/Transformed** into Domain Models.
7. **Domain Model(s) or error** are returned to the Bloc/Cubit.
8. **Bloc/Cubit emits a New State.**
9. **UI Widgets rebuild** to reflect the new state.

---

### Facilitating Inter-Feature Communication

- **Surface-Level (Navigational):**
  - Managed in `main.dart` or a router config file.
  - Features navigate via named routes (e.g., `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/featureB_view')`).
  - Avoids direct import dependencies between feature UIs.
- **Deeper (Data-Driven):**
  - Mediated through shared repositories in the `core` folder.
  - Repositories are provided high in the widget tree (e.g., with `RepositoryProvider`).
  - Repositories may expose data as **Streams** (e.g., `Stream<List<Session>>`).
  - Features subscribe to streams and react to updates, enabling a reactive, decoupled system.

---

### Managing Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Dependency Injection:**
  - Uses `RepositoryProvider` and `BlocProvider` from `flutter_bloc` for dependency management and testability.
- **Consistent Styling & Theming:**
  - Centralized in `lib/core/style/` (e.g., `themes.dart`).
- **Shared Widgets:**
  - Common UI elements in `lib/core/widgets/`.
- **Utilities & Formatters:**
  - Helper functions in `lib/core/utils/`.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Repositories return results indicating success/failure (e.g., `Either`, custom `Result`, or typed exceptions).
  - Blocs/Cubits translate errors into UI states (e.g., `ErrorState`).
- **Application Configuration:**
  - Centralized (e.g., `firebase_options.dart`, environment configs).

---

### Advantages of This Architectural Approach

- **Modularity & Decoupling:** Features are well-isolated and easy to manage.
- **Testability:**
  - Blocs/Cubits can be unit-tested with mocked repositories.
  - Domain logic is testable in isolation.
  - Repository implementations can be tested with mocked data sources.
  - Widget testing is simplified by providing mock Blocs/Cubits.
- **Scalability:** New features or changes have localized impact.
- **Maintainability:** Clear structure reduces cognitive load and risk of regressions.
- **Parallel Development:** Teams can work on different features concurrently with minimal conflicts.

### Potential Considerations and Trade-offs

- **Initial Setup Complexity:**
  - Higher than monolithic approaches; more boilerplate and a steeper learning curve.
- **For Small/Simple Projects:**
  - Strict layering may be overkill, but pays off as the app grows.
