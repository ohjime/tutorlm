# Project Objective

Our proposed tutoring mobile app aims to bridge the gaps in existing online tutoring systems by offering a personal, paid service that ensures quality and consistency. Tutors are required to conduct at least one session per week, making them readily available to students no matter where they are. By prioritizing educated, personalized student-tutor relationships, the app matches each learner with the right expert tailored to their needs. We aim to implement a dedicated feedback section that enables tutors to upload materials such as annotated homework PDFs and supplementary documents so students can easily access and review feedback at any time. Additionally, the application includes offline capabilities, ensuring continuous support even without a stable internet connection.
