The application will provide a user-friendly interface for both tutors and students, allowing them to create profiles, search for available tutors or students, and manage their tutoring sessions.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"design/objective":{"id":"design/objective","title":"Project Objective","description":"Our proposed tutoring mobile app aims to bridge the gaps in existing online tutoring systems by offering a personal, paid service that ensures quality and consistency. Tutors are required to conduct at least one session per week, making them readily available to students no matter where they are. By prioritizing educated, personalized student-tutor relationships, the app matches each learner with the right expert tailored to their needs. We aim to implement a dedicated feedback section that enables tutors to upload materials such as annotated homework PDFs and supplementary documents so students can easily access and review feedback at any time. Additionally, the application includes offline capabilities, ensuring continuous support even without a stable internet connection.","sidebar":"designSidebar"},"development/domain":{"id":"development/domain","title":"Domain Layer Documentation","description":"Overview","sidebar":"developmentSidebar"},"development/features/app":{"id":"development/features/app","title":"App Overview","description":"The app feature encompasses the core functionalities and user interface of the application.

Our approach is fundamentally geared towards creating a system that is modular, scalable, easily testable, and straightforward to maintain over time. To achieve these goals, we primarily employ a feature-first organizational structure, where the codebase is segmented by distinct application capabilities. This structure is further reinforced by principles inspired by Clean Architecture, which guide us in establishing a clear separation of concerns across different layers of the application.","sidebar":"developmentSidebar"},"development/setup-deployment":{"id":"development/setup-deployment","title":"Deploying the Application: A Grand Adventure","description":"Reader Beware.
